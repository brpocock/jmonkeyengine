How you actually name or number these milestones is up to you. People use the words “milestone”, Greek letters, versions, numbers, or combinations thereof.
</p>

<p>
Every milestone has a development phase and a test phase. Here are some best practices:

You have a list of features that you want in game, but which one do you implement first? You will keep adding features to a project that grows more and more complex, how can you minimize the amount of rewriting required? 

</p>
<ol>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Start with implementing the most complex game feature first – the one that imposes most constraints on the structure of your project (for instance, networking.)</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Make sure the game&#039;s high-level frame (screen switching, networking, physics, loading/saving) is sound and solid before you implement low-level details of gameplay. </div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Only add one larger feature at a time. If there are complex interactions (such as “networking + physics”), start with a small test case (“one cube”) and work your way up, don&#039;t start with a whole scene.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Test for side-effects on existing code before you add the next feature.</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>

Acknowledge whether you want a feature because it is necessary for gameplay, or simply because “everyone else has it”. Successful high-performance games are the ones where someone made smart decisions what to keep and what to drop. 
</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Example: Everybody wants “full physics, AI, post-rendering effects, and multi-player networking”… Make certain you truly understand what that requires (e.g. client-server synchonization)! Your goal should be to bring out the essence of your game idea, don&#039;t water down gameplay but attempting to make it “do everything, but better”. </div>

<div class="level3">

<p>

As your jME3-based application grows more advanced, you may find yourself putting more and more tests in the simpleUpdate() loop, and passing around lots of object references. Don&#039;t implement game behaviour by copying and pasting boilerplate code! It is a best practice to move game behaviour into classes of their own. In jME3 these classes are Controls and AppStates.

</p>
<ul>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Use Controls to implement the behaviour of types of game entities. A character control that defines how this type of Spatials moves, an animation control that plays animations in this type of Spatial&#039;s model, etc.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Use AppStates to implement global game behaviour: A physics manager, a custom artificial intelligence manager, etc.</div>
</li>
<li class="level1"><div class="li"> Use the simpleUpdate() loop for the remaining “one-off” tests and interactions.</div>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

Both classes automatically hook into the main update loop. Instead of remote controlling game entities via simpleUpdate(), you define the desired behaviour in the update methods of custom Controls and AppStates. You then add Controls to Spatials, and AppStates to the application, and jME3 will automatically trigger the update methods. This cleans up your simpleUpdate() loop code considerably.

<p>

Unit Tests (Java Assertions) have a different status in 3D graphics development than in other types of software. You cannot write any assertions that automatically test whether the rendered image looks correct, or whether interactions are intuitive. Still you should create simple test cases for separate game features such as loaders, content generators, effects. Run them now and then to see whether they still work as intended – or whether they are affected by side effects. Keep the test classes in a test directory in the project, but don&#039;t include them in the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Quality Assurance (QA) means maintaining a clear list of steps that must always work, and checking them. There can be bugs in software, but tasks such as installing and de-installing, saving and loading, starting/pausing/quitting the game, <em>must work</em>, no excuse. After every milestone, you go through the list again, on every supported operating system, and systematically look for regressions or bugs. 
</p>

<p>
Alpha and Beta Testing means that you ask someone to try to install and run your game. It should be a real user situation, where they are left to figure it out by themselves (you only can include the usual read-me and help docs). Provide the testers with an easy method to report back descriptions of their problems, e.g. why they gave up. Evaluate whether these problems are exceptions or must be fixed for the game to be playable.
