I am unable to get images to load and display properly except for square images
with the side length an even power of 2.  I have tried many strategies to
display only a portion of a square image file, or to stretch to the desired
dimensions, but all attempts either do not work or add too much distortion.
The following idiom works.
[By "even" here, and below, I mean zero modulus, not zero as in odd-or-even.]

Dice up your original image into squares, each square of which is an even
power of 2 (in pixels).  You still need to export your original image so that
its with and its height are both an even multiple of the same even power of 2.
For example, if you export your source image to size 224x40, that would work
since both dimensions are multiples of 2^3 = 8:
    224 = 28 * 2^3
    40 = 5 * 2^3

Dicing script
-------------
I write the script "diceimage.bash" to dice up an image as described.  To
dice up the 224x40 pixel image described above, you would run:

    diceimage.bash 28 5 8

This would generate 140 (28 times 5) 8x8 pixel images.
