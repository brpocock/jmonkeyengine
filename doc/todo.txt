TODO LIST

Fix bug with axis rotation

Find out how to retrieve export or data file preference directory from Blender.
Default export director to that.

Enhance script to honor a BLENDER_SWITCHES env variable + to add:
-b /dev/null

Instead of rejecting meshes with 3 + 4 vertexes, just detect this situation
and automatically convert to Tris, writing a warning to stdout.

Make a blenderexp test that requires the shell script to run, setting
 COORDS if necessary, and adding -noaudio, -nojoystick, -noglsl.

Add license file to repository and distribution.
