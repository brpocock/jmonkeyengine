TODO LIST

The Blender materials don't have a basic material alpha setting, just RGB.
Look into whether I should get the alpha value for the jME color float[4]s
from somewhere.  Just setting all alphas to 1 for now.

Handle unusual Blender objects like non-face items, non-data meshes, etc.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.
