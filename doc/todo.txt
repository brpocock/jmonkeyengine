TODO LIST

Add license file to repository and distribution.

Finish the jme.xml unit test implementation.  Put real data into the test
data file "mix.xml", and convert the display-only tests to use the unittest
module.

Re-work the elegant UTF code to handle UTF-8 as much as possible without the
codecs module, because Blender does not include that module.  It's a shame :(.

Add tests of new XmlFile class to the jme.xml tests.

Add Blender exporter artifacts.  The menu registration script, prototype
exporter script, logo image.

Add utility scripts for running the Blender-specific scripts and unit tests
from the command line.  Without this, one would need to run Blender
interactively to use any of these scripts.  [This is because the Blender-
provided packages are only available from the Blender binary environment].
