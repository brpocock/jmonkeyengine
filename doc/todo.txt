TODO LIST

string.upper() the encoding value in the XML PI.

Make sure all test methods "" commented.  testunit reports much better with.
REFACTOR according to new things I've learned about Python
    No \ necessary if continuing a [list] or (parameters), and even for
     expressions inside of ().
    Use + to concatenate lists, incl. l1 += l2

Add .blend and .xml files for end-to-end Blender env unit tests.

Enforce scene node name uniqueness.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.

STUCK.  Unable to run any Blender environment test scripts, because Blender is
giving me a segmentation fault when I try to open a *.blend file from Python,
like "Blender.Load('/file/path.blend')".  I need to try on a different
computer.  Can still test stuff that doesn't require a *.blend file, but the
whole point here is to verify that complex input (like what is stored in a
*.blend file) gets exported accurately.
