TODO LIST

Add more model conversion unit tests to simplemodels.py.

Enforce scene node name uniqueness.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.

STUCK.  Unable to run any Blender environment test scripts, because Blender is
giving me a segmentation fault when I try to open a *.blend file from Python,
like "Blender.Load('/file/path.blend')".  I need to try on a different
computer.  Can still test stuff that doesn't require a *.blend file, but the
whole point here is to verify that complex input (like what is stored in a
*.blend file) gets exported accurately.
