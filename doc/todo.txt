TODO LIST

Consider not writing JmeMaterial referencing elements if the referrent is the
object link of an ancestor Object.  In jME, it is more efficient and powerful
to use scene graph parent/child relationships to inherit colors than to
require explicit links in every material-using node.

Per nymon:  ...give the option of exporting with the modifiers applied, instead of having to save, apply them, export, then reload. The OBJ exporter that comes with Blender does this...

Install archived version of Blender and set the Blender version in
"blenderjmeexp_reg.py" to the oldest version that this product works with.

Consider refactoring the huge amount of code in JmeNode.getXmlEl concerned
with accommodating face-specific colors and uv values.  I think this could be
done more simply and efficiently by adding a per-UpdatableMVert .col and by
populating UpdateableMVert.uvco from per-vertex uvs.

Handle unusual Blender objects like lights, cameras, non-face meshes,
non-data meshes, etc.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.
