TODO LIST

Add toggle to the exporter to allow disabling of the file stamp.
This will make it easier to compare output (like for unit tests!).

Change array hash to be ordered, to prevent indeterminacy which can effect
tests.

Find out how to retrieve export or data file preference directory from Blender.
Default export directory to that.

Enhance script to honor a BLENDER_SWITCHES env variable + to add:
-b /dev/null

Make a blenderexp test that requires the shell script to run, setting
 COORDS if necessary, and adding -noaudio, -nojoystick, -noglsl.

Add license file to repository and distribution.
