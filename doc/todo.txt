TODO LIST

If current window not large enough for our gui box, throw up a pop-up
notifying, and explaining that script windows should be closed.

Handle unusual Blender objects like non-face items, non-data meshes, etc.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.
