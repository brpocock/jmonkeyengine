TODO LIST

Install archived version of Blender and set the Blender version in
"blenderjmeexp_reg.py" to the oldest version that this product works with.

Consider refactoring the huge amount of code in JmeNode.getXmlEl concerned
with accommodating face-specific colors and uv values.  I think this could be
done more simply and efficiently by adding a per-UpdatableMVert .col and by
populating UpdateableMVert.uvco from per-vertex uvs.

Handle unusual Blender objects like lights, cameras, non-face meshes,
non-data meshes, etc.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.
