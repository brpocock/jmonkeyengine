TODO LIST

Finish the jme.xml unit test implementation.  Put real data into the test
data file "mix.xml", and convert the display-only tests to use the unittest
module.

Add tests of new XmlFile class to the jme.xml tests.

Add Blender exporter artifacts.  The menu registration script, prototype
exporter script, logo image.

Add utility scripts for running the Blender-specific scripts and unit tests
from the command line.  Without this, one would need to run Blender
interactively to use any of these scripts.  [This is because the Blender-
provided packages are only available from the Blender binary environment].

Once have the exporter to a state where it runs, test on a PC with no
Python installed, to verify that our exporter has no dependencies beyond
Blender itself.
