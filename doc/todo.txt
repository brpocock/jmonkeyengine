TODO LIST

Track down Quaternine bug where complex but valid Blender transformed object
does not import to JME with correct orientation.  Problem even occurs with
the old jME V2 exporter.

Find out how to retrieve export or data file preference directory from Blender.
Default export directory to that.
EGAD:  Terrible situation.  There is no reliable way to save preferences or
whatever data to the FS across Blender invocations.  Unable to extract the
path to the current file.  Blender.Library.GetName() is useless; user path
preferences are generally not used; current directory is usually useless.
For now, user is going to have to navigate to desired target directory the
first export for each session.

STUCK.  Unable to run any Blender environment test scripts, because Blender is
giving me a segmentation fault when I try to open a *.blend file from Python,
like "Blender.Load('/file/path.blend')".  I need to try on a different
computer.  Can still test stuff that doesn't require a *.blend file, but the
whole point here is to verify that complex input (like what is stored in a
*.blend file) gets exported accurately.
