TODO LIST

string.upper() the encoding value in the XML PI.

Enhance blenderscript.bash.
    Produce a warning against wrapper script if $PWD is the blender directory.
    Re-code the write check to accommodate Windows quirk.
    Support MinGW/Cygwin:
        Use relative instead of absolute paths
        Change interpreter line to just use /bin/sh
    Drop the quit and wrap generated script with a try/expect.
    Have the previous item display good stack trace.
    Optimize command-line params.  Only need EITHER -p or -b.

Make sure all test methods "" commented.  testunit reports much better with.
REFACTOR according to new things I've learned about Python
    No \ necessary if continuing a [list] or (parameters), and even for
     expressions inside of ().
    Use + to concatenate lists, incl. l1 += l2

Enforce scene node name uniqueness.

As soon as I implement proper schema validation in jME core, add the namespace
specs to generated XML.

STUCK.  Unable to run any Blender environment test scripts, because Blender is
giving me a segmentation fault when I try to open a *.blend file from Python,
like "Blender.Load('/file/path.blend')".  I need to try on a different
computer.  Can still test stuff that doesn't require a *.blend file, but the
whole point here is to verify that complex input (like what is stored in a
*.blend file) gets exported accurately.
