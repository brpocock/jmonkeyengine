Python Coding Conventions
-------------------------

Only use modules and features included in the Blender-provided Python engine.
Specifically:

    Do not use "except X as y".  [Use "except X, y" instead]

    Do not use xml.sax

    Do not use string.encode(), string.decode(), or specify an encoding
    type to the unicode() function.  [VERY ANNOYING!]

If you catch an exception, but the cause could possibly be a code problem,
make sure to report the source code location if you don't re-throw.  For
example, in an exception-catching block:
        ei = exc_info()[2]
        while ei:
            print "  " + ei.tb_frame.f_code.co_filename + ':' \
                + str(tb_lineno(ei))
            ei = ei.tb_next print e
If you catch an exception but don't handle it entirely, you should often
rethrow by just calling "raise".

Bundled files.
If you need to bundle files to be read in by our product at runtime, follow
the example that jmetest/xml.py uses to load the test data *.xml file(s).
The package supplies functions to resolve relative paths to files within the
package, and methods to read the contents of them.
