* Rigorous XML generation (consistent indentation, detection of illegal XML
   keywords, conversion of illegal XML characters where possible).
* Write single mesh object, with and without color vertexes and normals
* Write multiple top-level mesh objects
* Writes defaultColor to Meshes if blenderObject.color set (Blender doesn't
   "show" the color, so need scripting or an add-on to set this).
* Write vertex colors
* Write nested mesh objects, preserving the parent/child relationships
* Write trivial color materials
* Write materials with color and other basic settings (reflectivity et. al.)
* Add exporter setting to export all "exportable" items in the current scene,
  instead of the default of exporting the exportable subset of currently-
  selected items.
  Write basic texture map materials

  Write armatures
  Add support for Object RB* game settings.  These would be very useful for
   jME games.  Like, custom Bondary objects, Physics integration, action hooks.
