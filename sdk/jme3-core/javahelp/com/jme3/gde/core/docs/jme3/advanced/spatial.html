<h1><a

class="level1"><p> This is an introduction to the concept of of Spatials, the elements of the 3D scene graph. The scene graph is a data structure that manages all objects in your 3D world. For example it keeps track of the 3D models that you load and position. When you extend a Java class from com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication, you inherit the scene graph and rootNode.</p><p> The main element of the scene graph is a Spatial called rootNode. All other Spatials are <em>attached</em> to the rootNode in a parent-child relationship. If you think you want to understand the scene graph better, please read <a

Instead you create (e.g. load) a Node or Geometry object, and cast it to Spatial. You use the Spatial type in methods that accept both Nodes and Geometries as arguments.</p></div><h3><a
