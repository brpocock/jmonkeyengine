As opposed to a vector (which looks similar), a coordinate does not have a &quot;direction&quot;. <a

When you normalize a vector, it still has the same direction, but you lose the information where the vector originally pointed.
For instance, you normalize vectors before calculating angles.</p></div><h3><a

name="cross_product">Cross Product</a></h3><div
class="level3"><p> The cross product is a calculation that you use to find a perpendicular vector (an orthogonal, a &quot;right angle&quot; at 90°).
In 3D space, speaking of an orthogonal only makes sense with respect to a plane. You need two vectors to uniquely define a plane. The cross product of the two vectors, <code>v1 × v2</code>, is a new vector that is perpendicular to this plane. A vector perpendicular to a plane is a called <em>Surface Normal</em>.
Example: The x unit vector and the y unit vector together define the x/y plane. The vector perpendicular to them is the z axis. JME can calculate that this equation is true: <br/> <code>( Vector3f.UNIT_X.cross( Vector3f.UNIT_Y ) ).equals( Vector3f.UNIT_Z )</code> == true</p></div><h2><a

The advantage of a mesh is that it is mathematically simple enough to render in real time, and detailed enough to be recognizable.
Every shape is reduced to a number of connected polygons, usually triangles; even round surfaces such as spheres are reduced to a grid of triangles. The polygons&#039; corner points are called vertices. Every vertex is positioned at a coordinate, all vertices together describe the outline of the shape.
You create 3D meshes in tools called mesh editors, e.g in Blender. <a

When texturing a wide area (e.g. walls, floors), you don&#039;t create one huge texture, instead you tile a small texture repeatedly to fill the area.
A seamless texture is an image file that has been designed so that it can be used as tiles: The right edge matches the left edge, and the top edge matches the bottom edge. The onlooker cannot easily tell where one starts and the next one ends, thus creating an illusion of a huge texture. The downside is that the tiling becomes painfully obvious when the area is viewed from a distance. Also you cannot use it on more complex models such as characters.</p></div><h2><a

For more complex objects, you design the texture in the same ways as a sewing pattern: One image file contains the outline of the front, back, and side of the object, next to one another. Specific areas of the flat texture (UV coordinates) map onto certain areas of your 3D model (XYZ coordinates), hence the name UV map.
Getting the seams and mappings right is crucial: You will have to use a graphic tool like Blender to create UV Maps. It&#039;s worth the while to learn this, UV mapped models look a lot more professional.</p></div><h2><a

You create a Cube Map to represent your environment, similar to a skybox. (Sphere Maps are possible, but often look too distorted.) You give the Cube Map a set of images showing a &quot;360° view&quot; of the completed scene. The renderer uses this as base to texture the reflective surface.
Of course these reflections are static and not &quot;real&quot;, e.g. the player will not see his avatar&#039;s face reflected, etc… But they cause the desired &quot;glass/mirror/water&quot; effect, and are fast enough to render in real usecases, it&#039;s better than nothing.</p></div><h2><a

class="level2"><p> You provide the texture in two or three resolutions to be stored in one file (MIP = &quot;multum in parvo&quot; = &quot;many in one&quot;). Depending on how close (or far) the camera is, the engine automatically renders a more (or less) detailed texture for the object. Thus objects look smooth from close up, but don&#039;t waste resources with unspottable details when far away. Good for everything, but requires more time to create and more space to store textures.</p></div><h2><a

class="level2"><p> A procedural texture is generated from repeating one small image, plus some pseudo-random, gradient variations (Perlin noise). Procedural textures look more natural than static rectangular textures, for instance, they look less distorted on spheres. On big meshes, their repetitiveness is much less noticable than tiled seamless textures. Procedural textures are ideal for irregular large-area textures like grass, soil, rock, rust, and walls.

class="level1"><p> Non-player (computer-controlled) characters (NPCs) are only fun in a game if they do not stupidly bump into walls, or blindly run into the line of fire. You want to make NPCs &quot;aware&quot; of their surroundings and let them make decisions based on the game state – otherwise the player can just ignore them. The most common use case is that you want to make enemies interact in a way so they offer a more interesting challenge for the player.
&quot;Smart&quot; game elements are called artificially intelligent agents (AI agents). An AI agent can be an NPC, but also an &quot;automatic alarm system&quot; that locks doors after an intruder alert, or a trained pet.
The domain of artificial intelligence deals, among other things, with:</p><ul><li
class="level1"><div
class="li"> Knowledge – An agent only &quot;knows&quot; what it can &quot;see and hear&quot;, this implies that things can be hidden from it. You can make a group of agents share knowledge (e.g. guards with two-way radios know, other guards don&#039;t know about the intruder).</div></li><li
class="level1"><div
class="li"> Goal Planning – The agent has a priority to achieve a specific goal (a future state). It splits the goal into subgoals, determines tactics and strategies, and prioritizes them. The agent keeps testing whether the current state is closer to the (sub)goal. If unsuccessful, the agent changes the tactics/strategy. E.g. Finding the best path to reach a target in a changing environment.</div></li><li
class="level1"><div
class="li"> Problem solving – The agent uses a given set of facts and rules to deduct what state it is in. In every state, only a certain subset of reactions makes sense. The actual decision depends on the agent&#039;s goal. Examples: If target in range, attack or protect base or raise alarm. If idle, lay traps or heal oneself or recharge ammunition. If floor on fire, then danger. If danger, escape or kamikaze.</div></li></ul><p> There are lots of resources explaining interesting AI algorithms:</p><ul><li
