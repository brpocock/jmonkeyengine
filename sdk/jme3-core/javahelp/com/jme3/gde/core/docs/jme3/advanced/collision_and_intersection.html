name="collision_and_intersection">Collision and Intersection</a></h1><div
class="level1"><p> The term collision can be used to refer to physical interactions (where physical objects collide and bump off one another), and also to non-physical intersections. This article is about non-physical (mathematical) collisions.
Non-physical collisions are interesting because they take less resources than physical ones. You cn optimize your game if you find a way to simulate a certain effect in a non-physical way, using mathematical techniques such as ray casting.
One example for an optimization is a physical vehicle&#039;s wheels. You could make the wheels fully physical disks, and have jME calculate every tiny force – sounds very accurate, but is total overkill. An more performant solution is to cast four rays down from the vehicle and calculate the intersections with the floor and other obstacles. These non-physical wheels require (in the simplest case) only four calculations to achieve an effect that players can hardly distinguish from the real thing.</p></div><h2><a
name="bounding_volumes">Bounding Volumes</a></h2><div
class="level2"><p> A com.jme3.bounding.BoundingVolume is an interface for dealing with containment of a collection of points. All BoundingVolumes are Collidable and are used as optimization to calculate non-physical collisions more quickly: It&#039;s faster to calculate an intersection between simple shapes like spheres and boxes than between complex shapes. In cases where precision is not relevant, you wrap a complex model in a simpler shape to improve collision detection performance.</p><ul><li

name="collisions">Collisions</a></h2><div
class="level2"><p> The interface com.jme3.collision.Collidable declares one method that returns how many collisions were found between two Collidables: <code>collideWith(Collidable other, CollisionResults results)</code>.
A <code>com.jme3.collision.CollisionResults</code> object is an ArrayList of comparable <code>com.jme3.collision.CollisionResult</code> objects.
You can iterate over the CollisionResults to identify the other parties involved in the collision. Note that jME counts <em>all</em> collisions, this means a ray intersecting a box will be counted as two hits, one on the front where the ray enters, and one on the back where the ray exits.</p><div
