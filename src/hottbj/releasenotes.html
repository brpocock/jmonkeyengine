    <h3>HottBJ Exporter Help</h3>
    Covers version ${product.version} of the
    <b><i>Handy Object Transfer Tool, Blender to jME</i></b>.
    <BR/>

    </p><p>
    The 0.2 series of the exporter introduced detailed support for Skin &amp;
    Bones.
    The 0.3 series greatly extended and improved animation support, and
    introduced many game integration features.
    </p><p>
    The 0.4 series has improved and rounded out material and texture support,
    including support for multiple Materials per Blender Object.

    <p>
    Thanks to Tom Trocha for providing excellent user support.  This has freed
    me up to improve the exporter.
    </p><p>
    Ashton V. was extremely helpful to the 0.2 effort, both for his keen
    insight, and for his continual enthusiasm.
    Without his encouragement, I would not have stuck it out to the end.
    </p><p>
    Sincere thanks also to Joshua Slack, for fixing a 0.2 animation bug which
    had halted all progress.

    <h4 id="changelist">Change List</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes since 0.3f<ol>
        <li>Write morphInfluences for Armature Objects.
            This is a great way to centrally manage multiple morphs for an
            Armature assembly.
        <li>Proper support for Blender texture image flag settings
            <code>MipMap</code> and <code>Interpol</code>.
            Until now we required both toggles to be set, but, sadly, still
            left both features unset in the exports.
        <li>Implemented proper support and validation of Material Indexes.
            I.e. support multiple materials per Blender Object.
        <li>Support for multiple texture channels.
            Each such channel may do per-face or sticky vert UV mapping.
        <li>Support for multiple uv layers.
        <li>OB and ME type Material links are now translated according to
            robust rules which can be generalized to:  Mats are translated
            to RenderStates on a TriMesh or QuadMesh, except for normal
            Blender Mesh Objects with a single (Material Index) OB Material
            Link.  Node Render States can not be applied properly to other
            situations.
        <li>Partial implementation of FAVORJOIN mode, where jME Nodes are
            created only where necessary, instead of the default behavior to
            mirror Blender as close as possible.
        <li>[Significantly missing from release 0.4a are documentation updates.]
        </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.3e<ol>
        <li>Eliminated requirement for Bone Heat.
        Apply bone weights using your favorite method for now on.
        <li>Bugs fixed which caused corruption on the jME side when some skin
        vertexes were not weighted.
        <li>Support skin &amp; bones weightings where some verts have no
        weights.
        <li>Class files excluded from distros (they added an unnecessary
         tight binding/dependency between HottBJ version and jME version).
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.3d<ol>
        <li>Output model files now renderer-independent.
        <li>Fixed armature export bug.
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.3c<ol>
        <li>Improvements to pre-validation of animation setup.
        <li>State restoration is now reliable.
        <li>Write SkinNode components with relationships exactly matching that
         used by jME natively.
        <li>Game properties of format "jme.*" stripped from exported UserData
          in a general and efficient way.  These properties are for internal
          use of the exporter.  Users should use their own name prefix, or none.
        <li>Added support for jME's new SkinTransferNodes, for writing skin
          meshes which can be swapped in and out at jME runtime.
        <li>Added support for jME skin regions, by use of game properties named
        "jme.skinRegion" or object names with suffix @regionName.
        <li>Fixed poor formatting when hash value for Texture exceeds Python
        data type's value range.
        <li>Since a Rest Pose Frame is required for skin assimilation in jME,
        the exporter now looks for one and identifies the best one to the
        <code>AnimationController</code>.
        <li>Since Actions are always written with Armatures, I've switched the
        corresponding <code>AnimationController</code> to be <i>inactive</i>.
        Easy enough for the developer to set to active when needed.
        <li>Per-Action frame names are now transferred and used by jME's
        <code>BoneAnimation</code>.  For now, user must set a game property of
        name <code>jme.frameNames.YOUR_ACTION_NAME</code>, but want to use
        Blender's pose markers automatically in the future.
        <li>Support for new jME morphing feature.
        <li>Wrote new Online Help page about HottBJ's game integration features.
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.3b<ol>
        <li>One armature may now skin multiple deforming meshes (via parenting
         and/or modifier associations).
        <li>Fixed bug with texture sharing which sometimes caused some
        textures to be replaced with references to others in the same export.
        <li>Added rigorous checking for bone scales which could produce
        inaccurate exports.
        <li>Fixed logic bug which somes resulted in valid animation channels
        being dropped.
        <li>Fixed bug which broke export of non-skinned bone animations.
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.3a<ol>
        <li>Objects in non-selected Blender layers are automatically excluded
        from exports, regardless of all-in-scene or selected-item mode.
      </ol>
      See Subversion log for history before the 0.3 series.
