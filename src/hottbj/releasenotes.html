    This incremental beta release adds minor enhancements and fixes beyond 0.2c,
    with substantial improvements to documentation and bundled examples.

    <h4 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h4>
    <p>
    The 0.2 series of the exporter introduces detailed support for Skin &amp;
    Bones.
    </p><p>
    Ashton V. was extremely helpful to the 0.2 effort, both for his keen
    insight, and for his continual enthusiasm.
    Without his encouragement, I would not have stuck it out to the end.
    </p><p>
    Sincere thanks also to Joshua Slack, for fixing an animation bug which had
    halted all progress.

    <h4 id="changelist">Change List</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Changes since 0.2d<ol>
        <li>This product rebranded from "Blender ==> jME Exporter"
          to "HottBJ Exporter".
        <li>Fix bug where mat rejections cause export to abort, regardless of
          settings.
        <li>Improved animation/posing diagnostics
        <li>Animation optimization/culling algorithm reinstated
        <li>Fix to incorrect shader test (confused diffuse and specular shaders)
        <li>Added detection and graceful omission of bad frame numbers and
          empty animations
        <li>Fixed imperfect tests for non-effective matrix transformations
        <li>Added new function to once-and-for-all format floats exactly as I
          want them written.
        <li>Inverse value of stored "shiness" value, to accommodate jME's crazy
          implementation where the value actually indicates "unshininess".
        <li>Now allow user to specify either Phong or Cook Torr specular
          shader.  jME does nothing special with these, but these to are an
          indication that the user basically wants a "typical" specular look.
        <li>Fixed bug with ambient color calculation.
        <li>Fixed mistake in ambient color calculation description in online
          docs.
        <li>Use the Blender TexFace option as a hook to allow for a jME
          material-overlay trick.  This allows for overlaying a base material
          with an overlay texture where the base bleeds through transparent
          areas.
        <li>Support automatic jME instantiation of Spatial subclasses by use
          of a Blender String game property of name "jme.implClass".
        <li>Support automatic loading of all Blender game properties into jME
          UserData maps.  See sample file
          <code>src/hottbj/AppAttrNode.java</code>.
        <li>Refactored transform translations so that jME side will always get
          +Z-forward or -Y-forward Objects, depending on whether
          <code>Rotate X</code> is set.
        <li>Fixed nasty bug with non-deforming-bone-children.
          Not this, as well as normal object nesting under the Armature Object
          work very consistently and precisely.
        <li>The <i>Mountpoint</i> strategy was borne out of the fruits of the
          previous two items.  As I write this, Ashton is uploading his new
          video featuring Mountpoints.
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.2c<ol>
        <li>Enhanced existing Java sample class, and added new sample to
        exemplify jME-side usage of animation exports.
        <li>Support arbitrary start and end frame settings (except can't be
        within the range of the animations frame set).
        <li>Many fixes and enhancements to online docs, including addition of
        the page you are now reading.
        <li>Added support for <code>Empty</code> object types.
        <li>Added support for <code>Empty Mesh</code> object types, including
         support for our material inheritance feature.
        <li>Several TODO items taken care of, which verified proper handling
         of items such as no-deform bones, envelope options, arbitrary mixing
         of Loc + Rot + LocRot frames and channel selections.  The net effect
         to the software is primarily removal of TODO items and warnings in
         the code.
        <li>Documented requirements and suggestions for content of starting
         frames.  If these suggestions are followed, users can freely optimize
         following frames without dangers which would otherwise be incurred.
      </ol>
      <li>Changes since 0.1<ol>
        <li>General support for Blender Armatures.
            It would take too much work to list the individual features here.
            With a few significant exceptions, we extend our support for
            arbitrary object to the realm of armatures.
            See the <A href="skinandbones.html">Skin &amp; Bones page</A> for
            details on exporter support for Armatures.
      </ol>
